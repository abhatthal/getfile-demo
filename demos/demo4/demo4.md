# GetFile Demo 4
TODO:
	* Connect to file server instead of localhost.
	* Use the versioned symlink structure
	* Interactive pause of client code to manually update server file
		* We'll have an updated version and updated meta ready to go
	* Resume code to destroy GetFile instance and start a new instance
		* Confirm new changes are updated
